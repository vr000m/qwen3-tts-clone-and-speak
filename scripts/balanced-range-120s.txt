This is a natural reference script for voice cloning. I will speak clearly at a moderate pace with even breathing throughout.

Last Tuesday, I visited a small cafe near the train station. The atmosphere felt unusual but pleasant, and I enjoyed a quiet hour reading the newspaper. A friend called later to confirm our tour of the old castle.

The green field stretched wide under a pale morning sky. A cool breeze moved through the trees as the first birds began to sing. The air smelled fresh and pure after the night rain.

On the way home, I walked down a straight street past the square. Three children were playing near the fountain, their voices carrying clearly in the still air.

I will end with calm phrasing, steady rhythm, and consistent volume.
